# Auto Shusher

Arduino-based audio sensor that sends a keypress to mute your Mac mic via
[Shush](http://mizage.com/shush/).

## Why

Remote work can put you on calls all day long, especially if you practice pair
programming.  With so many hours spent on calls, a mute button is critical for
your sanity and the sanity of your co-workers.  At [my
company](http://verypossible.com/), most people prefer
[Shush](http://mizage.com/shush/).

However, it's hard to know exactly when your beloved child may start screaming
or faithful Fido will start barking furiously at the "intruder" passing by your
window.  In these instances, human reaction time for mute-button pressing are
incredibly lacking.  In addition, if you're flowing through a good coding
session, thinking about your mute button can kill the flow.
