# Auto Shusher

Arduino-based audio sensor that sends a keypress to mute your Mac mic via
[Shush](http://mizage.com/shush/).

## Why

Remote work can put you on calls all day long, especially if you practice pair
programming.  With so many hours spent on calls, a mute button is critical for
your sanity and the sanity of your co-workers.  At <a

prefer <a href="http://mizage.com/shush/" target="_blank">Shush</a>.

However, it's hard to know exactly when your beloved child may start screaming
or faithful Fido will start barking furiously at the "intruder" passing by your
window.  In these instances, human reaction time for mute-button pressing are
incredibly lacking.  In addition, if you're flowing through a good coding
session, thinking about your mute button can kill the flow.

## How

### Bill of Materials
The parts I used are linked below.  I had them lying around in my parts bin
already, so they were zero cost to me at the time I started this project.  I'm
sure you can find cheaper generic alternatives via Alibab or EBay.

  or other 32u4 based Arduino board which supports keyboard emulation.

## What about my fancy noise-cancelling headset?
Your noise-cancelling headset _is_ much smarter than this thing. However, it
doesn't completely block all the loud noises around you.  It's also more
expensive, and a lot less fun and flexible.

The AutoShusher works with _any_ headset headset at all, and was a fun and easy
excuse for me to use my soldering iron and 3D printer.
